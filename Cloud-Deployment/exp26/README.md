# 🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created using **[Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)**.  
It helps you quickly start a new React project without worrying about setup or configuration.

---

## 📦 What We Did

By using **Create React App**, we automatically set up a working React environment.  
It created all the necessary files, installed dependencies, and configured tools like:

- **Webpack** – bundles all your files together  
- **Babel** – converts modern JavaScript into compatible code  
- **ESLint** – checks for code errors and warnings  

This means we can **focus on coding** instead of doing setup manually.

## ⚙️ Available Commands

In your project folder, you can run these commands:

---

### ▶️ `npm start`

Runs the app in **development mode**.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in your browser.

- Automatically reloads when you save changes  
- Shows any errors or warnings in the console  
- Perfect for development and debugging

👉 Use this command while **building your app**.

---

### 🧪 `npm test`

Starts the **test runner** in watch mode.

- Automatically runs your test files whenever you change code  
- Helps detect bugs early during development

---

### 🏗️ `npm run build`

Creates a **production-ready** version of your app in the `build/` folder.

- Optimizes files for speed and performance  
- Minifies (compresses) JavaScript and CSS  
- Adds unique hash filenames for caching  

✅ Your app is **ready to be deployed** after this step.

### ⚙️ `npm run eject`

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This is permanent! Once you eject, you **cannot undo** it.

- CRA hides advanced configurations by default.  
- Running this command copies all setup files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.  
- You’ll then have **full control** over the configuration.  

💡 Only use this if you **need to customize** how React works.  
For most projects, the default setup is perfect.

## ❗ Troubleshooting

### When `npm run build` Fails to Minify

If you see this error:
> "npm run build fails to minify"

Try the following:
1. Make sure all dependencies are updated  
   ```bash
   npm update
   ```
2. Check that all your packages are compatible with your React version
3. Avoid unsupported ES6+ syntax in third-party libraries
4. If issues continue, see:
